## Figures ##
Two .m files, using which the figures shown in Figs. 10-14 are plotted.

## Source codes ##
“DDS-MCS.m” is related to DDS-MCS scheme, "B-DAMP.m", "E-B-DAMP.m", "A-B-DAMP.m", and "AE-B-DAMP.m" are our proposed schemes. "Tools" and "matData" are used to generate and store track matrices, respectively. "D-AMP_toolbox-master" is the toolbox of DAMP algorithm.

## Test datasets ##
"gravity.mat" and "period_gravity.mat" are Gravity anomaly datasets. The size of "gravity.mat" is 16384, and that of "period_gravity.mat" is 558424. 

## Trajectory ##
“screenUser_128.m” is used to create trajectory matrixes of the participants, which can be used in "./Source codes/Tools/". “change_500people_200to500steps_0to100go.mat” means to recruit 500 participants, and each person walks 200-500 steps, respectively.
